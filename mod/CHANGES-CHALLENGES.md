# Racing+ Mod Custom Challenges

* By pressing "Tab" on the challenges portion of the main menu, you can access custom challenges added by mods. The Racing+ mod uses custom challenges to facilitate multi-character speedruns where you must beat the game multiple times in a row on various characters.
* These custom challenges will automatically take you to the next character so that you never have to return to the menu. They will also show a timer on the screen and your current character progress.
* Before starting a speedrun, you must define a character order by using the "Change Char Order" custom challenge.
* You can restart with the current character by tapping R. You can go back to the first character by holding R. (On floors 2 and beyond, you have to double-tap R to restart with the current character.)

  * Instead of dying, players will respawn in the previous room with 1.5 soul hearts.
  * They will have a "debuff" effect that removes all of the items. The debuff will last 45 seconds.

## R+7 Seeded

* This challenge was only available in Q4 2018. A new version may be released in the future.
* You must defeat Blue Baby on the following 7 characters:
  * Isaac, Magdalene, Lazarus, Eden, The Lost, Apollyon, The Forgotten
  * These characters were randomly selected before the release of this challenge.
* Each run is played on the following 7 seeds:
  * 4PME M424, JFSC 2WW7, WEFG XQ6F, 4FAH GTDX, 3J46 P8BJ, 9YHG YKXH, BQ9S MATW
  * These seeds were randomly selected before the release of the challenge.
  * Resetting will not change the current character's seed.
  * The seeds are given in pre-set order and cannot be customized.
* All characters start with The Mind in addition to their other vanilla starting items. (This is a quality of life change to avoid having to refer to your notes as you play through each seed.)
* Runs for this challenge/category should not be uploaded to Speedrun.com until the season is over. (This ensures that everyone can find their own strategies and it keeps the winner a surprise until the very end!)
* Unlike the other challenges, exiting and going into a normal run will not cancel the speedrun (due to technical reasons). To set the game back to normal, use the "Finished" item that spawns in the starting room of the first character.

<br />

## R+15 Vanilla

* You must defeat Blue Baby on all 15 characters. (This does not include Samael.)
* There are no additional changes to the game.

<br />

## Races

* If you want to do a multiplayer race of one of the above seasons, then you can create a race with a format of "Custom" and a race goal of "Custom".
* Note that during the run, the place indicators will not be accurate. This is because the server does not know which character you are on; it only knows about your current floor.
