# Racing+ Mod Known Bugs

Some gameplay-related bugs are not fixable due to the limitations of the Afterbirth+ Lua API.

## Miscellaneous Bugs

* Various bugs will happen if you alternate between playing two different runs on two different save files.
* Fast-clear does not apply to Challenge Rooms.
* When returning to the Boss Rush from a crawlspace, the camera will jerk from the door to the location of the crawlspace.
* Rules cards will sometimes show vanilla seeds instead of tournament winners.

## Bugs with the Schoolbag

* If put A Pony or a White Pony into the Schoolbag during the charge, you will be put into a state where you are not able to shoot tears. Saving and quitting fixes this.
* If you are using a Breath of Life and perform a Schoolbag switch before releasing the spacebar, it will continue to drain your new active item.
* If you put Telekinesis into the Schoolbag while the effect is active, your other item will be drained. (Found by TaKer093)
* If you have Breath of Life inside a Schoolbag, it will automatically be dropped by the Butter! trinket if you hold down the "use item" button instead of immediately releasing it. (Found by Thoday)

## Bugs with Samael

* Picking up a 2nd Sacrificial Dagger will do nothing. Saving and quitting fixes this.
* The Flat Worm trinket causes thrown scythes to glitch out. This is purely a graphical glitch. (Found by TaKer093)
* If you have Ipecac and Death's Touch, the thrown scythe will become invisible. (Reported by Nariom)
* If you have Mom's Knife, you can bypass the throw charge with proper timing to infinitely throw the scythe at close range. (Found by TaKer093)
* You can keep the Scythe shot fully charged without pressing any attack button by charging the scythe and release all attack buttons in a slide transition. Once you press any attack button, the Scythe charge will be released and the bug is fixed. (Found by TaKer093)

  * Health Up (7)
  * Range Up (12)
